# Karl Chess Engine (~ 2500 Elo)

Karl Chess is a multi-threaded Python-based chess engine designed for playing chess games, analyzing positions, and providing a challenging opponent for players. The engine utilizes a combination of classic chess algorithms, board representation techniques, and modern enhancements for efficient move generation and evaluation.

Features:

* UCI Protocol Support: KarlPy follows the Universal Chess Interface (UCI) protocol, allowing seamless integration with various chess interfaces and applications.

* Syzygy Endgame Tablebases: The engine incorporates Syzygy endgame tablebases for positions with up to 5 pieces, enabling precise endgame play.

* Pesto Opening Book: KarlPy benefits from the Pesto opening book, enhancing its opening repertoire and strategic choices.

* Iterative Deepening: The engine employs iterative deepening to gradually explore the game tree, balancing search depth and computational efficiency.

* Transposition Table: KarlPy uses a transposition table to store and retrieve previously computed positions, optimizing search performance.

* Move Ordering: Efficient move ordering techniques, including killer moves and history heuristics, contribute to a more focused search and improved gameplay.

* Material and Positional Evaluation: The evaluation function combines material balance and positional considerations to assess the strength of positions and guide move selection.

* Multi-Threading: The engine leverages multi-threading for parallel processing, accelerating the search process and enhancing responsiveness.
